Patients and science are at the heart of everything we do, and we put careful consideration into determining the value and ultimately the cost of our medicines. Many factors go into these decisions such as the benefits our medicines provide and their potential to reduce healthcare spending on other costlier medical procedures. Equally important, these decisions enable us to invest in discovering and developing future innovative medicines where new treatments are needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,"We note that § 96065, Wholesale Acquisition Cost Increase Notification, subparagraph (c), states as follows: “Total wholesale acquisition cost increase includes the current proposed wholesale acquisition cost increase and the sum of the wholesale acquisition cost increases that occurred in the current calendar year to date and the two previous calendar years.” AstraZeneca’s current proposed WAC increase is effective January 1, 2020. The price increases for the two previous calendar years were effective January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, respectively. We believe that the plain language of § 96065 (c) unambiguously supports our original reporting methodology.
